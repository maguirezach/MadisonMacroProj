Data and code from a project on the Madison River, MT. Tributary influences &amp; macroinvertebrate communities

My project investigates how wild trout in the mainstem Madison River, Montana could be influenced by changing macroinvertebrate populations and what environmental factors are driving a decline in these populations. My objectives are to characterize water quality drivers of macroinvertebrates at tributary confluences by utilizing historical and ongoing sampling efforts by Montana FWP in the form of continuous datasets to explore relationships between trout populations (abundance, body size), macroinvertebrates (density and community composition), water temperature, and sediment. The second part of my research is using field surveys to investigate tributary confluences on the Madison River, specifically documenting how the available caloric opportunity for trout and macroinvertebrate community metrics in the benthos and the drift differ between the mouth of tributaries and the mainstem. This will elucidate the importance of multiple tributaries to trout from both a food source and a habitat perspective in a prized blue-ribbon fishery. If the healthy tributary confluences provide refuge through relatively cool water, reduced fine sediment, or preferred habitat, then this project will directly inform management strategies for wild trout and restoration efforts in this watershed in the future.
